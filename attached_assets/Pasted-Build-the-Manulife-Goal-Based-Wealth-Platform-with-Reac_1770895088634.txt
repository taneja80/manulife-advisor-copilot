Build the "Manulife Goal-Based Wealth Platform" with React, Recharts, and Framer Motion.

Prompt:

Build a high-fidelity, interactive Financial Advisor Dashboard.

1. Brand Identity (Strict):

Primary Green: #0C7143 (Manulife Corporate Green - Headers/Sidebars).

Action Green: #00A758 (Buttons/Highlights).

Alert Red: #D9534F (For "Off Track" goals).

Font: Sans-serif (Inter/Roboto), clean and corporate.

Layout: Sidebar navigation (Left), Main Stage (Center), AI Assistant (Right).

2. The "Entry Gate" Modal (App Launch):

When the app loads, show a glassmorphism modal asking: "Select Client Journey"

Option A: "New Client Discovery" -> (Leads to Goal Wizard).

Option B: "Existing Portfolio Review" -> (Leads to Dashboard).

3. Core Module: The Goal Simulator ("The Three Levers"):

Create a component called GoalSimulator.

Visual: A large Area Chart showing "Projected Wealth" vs "Goal Target".

The Levers (Interactive Sliders below chart):

"Monthly Savings": Range $0 - $50k. (Moving this up steepens the curve).

"Time Horizon": Range 2026 - 2050. (Moving this right extends the landing zone).

"Risk Profile": Steps [Conservative, Balanced, Growth, Aggressive]. (Changing this increases volatility bounds but steepens the curve).

The Output: A dynamic badge that says "Probability of Success: [X]%". If X < 75%, turn the badge Red. If > 75%, turn it Green.

4. Core Module: The "Portfolio Wrapper" (Psychology Shift):

In the PortfolioBuilder section, do NOT show a list of funds first.

Show a "Product Card" view:

Title: "Manulife Asia Growth Basket".

Big Metric: "Target Return: 8-10%".

DCA Toggle: A switch labeled "Enable Automatic Monthly Investment (DCA)". When toggled ON, show a "benefit" tooltip: "Reduces volatility risk by 30%."

Add a button: "View Underlying Holdings" (Accordion). Only when clicked does it reveal the list of mutual funds.

5. The AI Copilot (Right Sidebar):

Title: "Advisor Talking Points".

Logic:

If Probability < 70%: Display "Talking Point: Discuss increasing monthly savings by $500 to get back on track."

If Cash > 20%: Display "Talking Point: Inflation is eroding this cash. Recommend DCA into the Income Fund."

6. Mock Data:

Create a robust mockData.js with realistic Manulife fund names (e.g., "Manulife Global Franchise Fund", "Manulife Asia Pacific REIT").

Ensure the chart data reacts to the sliders (use simple multipliers for the demo).
